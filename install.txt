
Enthusiast - Installation Instructions
======================================

1. Unzip enthusiast.zip; it should create a directory named "backend".

2. Modify the backend/config.sample.inc.php file (see file for details)
   and save this file as config.inc.php.

   Optional: modify the signup/approval/update email templates found in
   the backend/email/ directory. See templatevars.txt for list of
   special email template variables you can use. You can also add your own
   custom email templates for use when mass-emailing members from
   backend/admin_email.php as TEMPLATENAME.txt files.

3. Create a directory named "backend" on your fanlisting's directory, e.g.,
   if your fanlisting is at http://fan.domain.com/myfanlisting, you should
   create http://fan.domain.com/myfanlisting/backend

4. Upload everything into /backend (including folders under it).

5. Go to /backend/install.php and follow instructions.

6. Delete install.php

7. If you want to enable affiliates, add /affiliates to your root directory
   (the same level as /backend), and, if needed, CHMOD the directory to 777.

8. Customize/include the necessary PHP files into your FL site (see below).



How to customize your additional fields for the join form
=========================================================
You can setup how your additional fields are shown on your join form by
creating a file called 'addform.inc.php' on your base directory (NOT in
/backend) and writing your additional fields there (see included file
for an illustration on how to go about it; feel free to modify/delete it if
you wish).

Important notes:
. Make sure your input tag names (the NAME attribute of
  input/textarea/select tags) are named as your database column is named,
  which can be seen at backend/config.inc.php (these are the values of
  the $additional_field_names[] variable).
. If you want to customize one field, you have to customize ALL of them. For
  example, you want to make only one of the additional fields into a select
  tag (a drop-down field); you not only have to include that in your
  form, but you will have to create input tags for all.
. Especially if your web server does not hide PHP errors when parsing
  PHP, or if you're just as nitpicky as I am, when using radio fields
  (i.e., <input type="radio" ...), you have to automatically select at least
  one (i.e., <input type="radio" checked="checked"... ).
. These additional forms only allow up to 255 characters, SPACES INCLUDED. So
  be sure to limit characters if you're using a textarea.



How to customize your members' list display
===========================================
You can edit how members' information are displayed on your listing by creating
a file called 'list.inc.php' on your base directory (NOT in /backend) and
writing your template there (see included file for an illustration on how to
go about it; feel free to modify/delete it if you wish, and modifying it (or
altogether deleteing it) is actually highly recommended as by default it
only serves to illustrate the different variables you can use).

Also, if you wish to use tables or list tags such as UL, OL, or DL, you can add
a 'listheader.inc.php' and 'listfooter.inc.php' file where you can add your
opening table/list tag (<table>, <ul>, <ol>, <dl>) and your closing table/list
tag (</table>, </ul>, </ol>, </dl>).

Some tips:
. $$fan_email_plain$$ is useful if you wish to not show the full email address
  on your members list, as $$fan_email$$ will do. The only advantage of
  $$fan_email$$ is because it's JavaScript-protected, people can still
  click on the email link and not need to edit the mangled email address.
  However, if this goes against your tastes, you can opt to use
  $$fan_email_plain$$ instead of $$fan_email$$, such as:
     <a href="mailto:$$fan_email_plain$$">@</a>
     Output (what can be seen on browser by visitor): @
     Output (what can be seen on status bar): mailto:user {at} domain.tld
  As opposed to:
     $$fan_email$$
     Output (what can be seen on browser by visitor): user@domain.tld
     Output (what can be seen on status bar): mailto:user@domain.tld
. $$fan_url_plain$$ is useful in the same way $$fan_email_plain$$ is; if
  you want to customize how links are shown. This is especially useful if you
  have a number of people joining with long URLs and your content space for
  the members' list is small:
     Member URL in database:
        http://www767.someverylongurl.com.uh/blah/blahagain/splashpage.htm
     Output of '$$fan_url$$' (what can be seen on the browser):
        www767.someverylongurl.com.uh/blah/blahagain/splashpage.htm
     Output of '<a href="$$fan_url_plain$$">web</a>' (what can be seen):
        web
  The only advantage of $$fan_url$$ is that it naturally incorporates your
  $link_target setting, though this is by no means a major advantage.



How to include the scripts in your site
=======================================
To see examples of how you can set up the scripts, see the accompanying
files:
 . index.php
 . join.php
 . list.php
 . update.php
 . lostpass.php
 . affiliates.php

Note: You MUST use ".php" as the extension for all the files you will be
including/putting these scripts in.

These are copy-paste scripts, feel free to modify if you like. ;)
