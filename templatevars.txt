=========================================

This document lists all special variables you can use when customizing the
signup, approval, and update information emails your fanlisting sends out.
Where included, items in parentheses are the config.inc.php variables the
special variable corresponds to.

These variables are case-sensitive. See the included default emails/samples
as a guide in making your own emails. Unless otherwise specified, these
variables can only be used for email templates.
